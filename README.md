# WaferMap

Wafer Bin Map DataSet(WaferMap) has more than 36000 wafer maps, including 1 normal pattern, 8 single defect pattern, and 29 mixed defect pattern, a total of 38 defect pattern.

## Requirements:

  Python 3+

  numpy scipy matplotlib tensorflow keras scikit-learn

## Instructionsï¼š
  Download and process the data in [data_mutil_label.npz](https://pan.baidu.com/s/19aEazgpLMBPBzjePSCTgHw) Extraction code: mrpm

  In the data set, "data['arr 0']" is the wafer image data, and "data['arr1']" is the label of the wafer image. The wafer map label has eight dimensions, corresponding to the defect mode of C2-C9 [in Wafer Map.png](Wafer%20Map.png)

  To train a model, run [train_mutil_label.py](train_mutil_label.py)
